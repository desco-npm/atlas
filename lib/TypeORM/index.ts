/**
  * TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, 
  * NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and 
  * JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features 
  * and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses 
  * databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications 
  * with multiple databases.
  * 
  * TypeORM supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, unlike all other JavaScript ORMs 
  * currently in existence, which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, 
  * maintainable applications the most productive way.
  * 
  * ORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as Hibernate, Doctrine and Entity Framework.
